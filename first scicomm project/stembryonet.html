									<p>StembryoNet is a deep-learning AI created to make predictions on embryo models. For this experiment 
                                        mouse post-implantation embryos were used and StembryoNet was able to identify whether the embryos were 
                                        developing normally or abnormally from very early stages. The model embryos were created from embryonic 
                                        and trophoblast stem cells in order to imitate early-stage mouse embryogenesis. </p>
                                        <p>Usually, scientists have to analyze each embryo individually in order to determine if they’re developing
                                             normally but now StembryoNet saves them the time! It turns out approximately only 23% of embryos studied 
                                             end up developing normally, so StembryoNet saves scientists a lot of anguish. </p>
                                             <p>StembryoNet is based on an already existing network named ResNet18 and was 
                                                trained with time-lapse images of mouse embryos during the first 90 hours of 
                                                development. The embryos are marked with fluorescent dyes to track how the 
                                                stem cells develop, and StembryoNet analyzes the embryos at multiple stages 
                                                to predict the probability of the embryo developing normally.</p>
                                                <p>StembryoNet is a particularly useful tool in studying development because 
                                                    it can synchronize past data to what it’s currently analyzing to make more 
                                                    accurate predictions. Generally, StembryoNet is deemed to be 88% accurate in 
                                                    predicting embryo outcomes, and 18 times faster than an expert embryologist. </p>
